## <a name="desc"></a>1. Description

This repository contains the codebase for the portfolio page, which is being developed as part of a challenge. The goal is to create a responsive and visually appealing portfolio that showcases your skills and projects. To style the web app, I utilized the Bootstrap library and customized it using Sass, as well as a separate custom CSS file. The combination of Bootstrap, Sass, and custom CSS allowed me to design and implement the desired visual elements and layout for the portfolio.

Landing Page:

## <a name="hero"></a>4. Hero Section

The hero section features a jumbotron with a title, sub-title, and placeholder text. It includes a picture or avatar of the portfolio owner, along with any other desired information.

## <a name="work"></a>5. Work Section
The work section displays the portfolio owner's projects in a grid format. Bootstrap cards are utilized for each project, providing a brief overview of the work. Clicking on the project images redirects users to the deployed applications.

## <a name="skills"></a>6. Skills Section
The skills section lists out the skills expected to be learned from the bootcamp or relevant experiences. It provides a quick summary of the key skills possessed by the portfolio owner.

## <a name="about"></a>7. About Me Section
The about me section provides additional information about the portfolio owner. It is placed in the same row as the skills section, offering a comprehensive overview of the portfolio owner's background and interests.

## <a name="footer"></a>8. Footer Section
The footer section contains hyperlinks that have a hover effect, providing a visually appealing interaction. Additionally, all buttons within the website display a box shadow upon hover.

## <a name="solution"></a>9. Solution
The Bootstrap solution implemented in this portfolio minimizes the use of media queries, relying on the responsive features and grid system provided by Bootstrap. The layout adapts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.

## <a name="learning"></a>10. Learning Outcome
During the development of this portfolio, I gained proficiency in using the Bootstrap library for rapid prototyping and iterating on application designs. I found Bootstrap's Grid system to be simpler and more efficient than raw CSS for building grids and flexbox containers. I also learned how to customize Bootstrap cards to achieve desired hover effects, separating different sections of the cards for a unique presentation. The use of Sass allowed me to further customize Bootstrap to fit my requirements.
